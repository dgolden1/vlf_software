COMPILATION OF ELECTRON CROSS SECTIONS USED BY A. V. PHELPS

Please refer to these data using the sources cited for each gas. 
Please do not refer to any of them as "JILA cross sections", 
because a) the data shown here for a given gas may come from 
several sources that should be referred to by the respective 
authors names; b) in most cases no one else at JILA or NIST has 
approved the data or even looked at it.  Reference to this data as 
"JILA data" could be interpreted incorrectly as indicating NIST 
approval and could jepordize my Web site usage.

GASES COMPILED: O2, N2, CO, CO2, H2, H2O, NO, SF6, He, Ne, Ar,
Xe, Na, and Mg 

Comments are made on cross sections from other sources for some 
of these and other gases.

WE MAKE NO CLAIMS FOR THESE CROSS SECTIONS BEYOND THOSE STATED IN 
THE PAPERS WHERE THEY ARE PUBLISHED OR CITED.  IN MOST CASES THESE
CROSS SECTIONS WERE ASSEMBLED IN THE 1970'S AND 1980'S.  IN ONLY A 
FEW CASES HAVE THEY BEEN MODIFIED OR TESTED SINCE THAT TIME. I DO 
NOT PLAN ANY UPDATES.  ADDITIONS HAVE BEEN MADE WHEN CROSS
SECTIONS HAVE BEEN ASSEMBLED FOR OTHER PURPOSES.  SINCE THE JILA 
INFORMATION CENTER WAS CLOSED BY NIST, THERE IS NO ONE THERE TO 
HELP YOU.  OPINIONS EXPRESSED ARE THOSE OF A. V. PHELPS AND DO NOT 
IMPLY JILA, CU, OR NIST APPROVAL.

The cross sections are in 1E-16 cm2.  The two-term Boltzmann code, 
BACKPRO, used in deriving our cross sections employs linear 
interpolation between points in the cross section tables.  
Therefore linear interpolation should be applied when using them. 
Except as noted below for N2, the cross sections listed in JILA 
Information Center Reports 26, 27, and 28 for N2, H2, and O2 
should be the same as those listed here.  (This aspect has not 
been checked in detail, so please inform me of discrepancies.)

It should be kept in mind that the momentum transfer cross sections 
tabulated are effective values that include the effects of inelastic 
collisions as is appropriate for use in the two-tern spherical harmonic 
expansion.  See, for example, Baraff and Buchsbaum, Phys. Rev. 130, 
1007 (1963) and Sec. IIB of Pitchford and Phelps, Phys. Rev. A 25, 
540 (1982).  Where data is available, the effective Qm is set 
equal to the sum of the inelastic cross sections plus the elastic 
momentum transfer cross section. This is an approximate relation.

Some of the terms used in the tables and the BACKPRO code are:

QSCALE is a factor by which the input cross sections from the 
various sources were multiplied to get the values shown here 
and used in the Boltzmann equation.  

ENERGY LOSS is the inelastic energy loss in eV.

LOWER LIMIT and UPPER LIMIT were used by BACKPRO to limit 
the range within which the tables were interpolated.  
Interpolation was the most time-consuming step in the code.

EBR is a parameter used to describe the sharing of energy
among the two electrons resulting from ionization.  It is
the parameter w in Yoshida, Phelps, and Pitchford, Phys. Rev. 
27, 1345 (1983) and its choice is based on the data of Opal, 
Peterson, and Beaty, Phys. Rev. 55, 4100 (1971).

BACKPRO is the FORTRAN code for the solution of the electron 
Boltzmann equation developed by Frost and Phelps, Phys. Rev. 
127, 1621 (1962) and modified by Phelps and coworkers in later 
papers.  A detailed analysis of the code as of 1975 has been
given by P.H. Luft, JILA Information Center Report No. 14, 
October 1975.  Changes since then are minimally documented, 
but include accounting for the electrons produced by electron
impact ionization during either a spatial or temporal 
exponential growth.  See Yoshida et al as cited above.

These cross sections were derived to give a good fit 
to published electron transport, excitation coefficient, 
attachment coefficient, and ionization coefficient data 
for the pure gases.  In many cases they have been tested 
satisfactorily against similar swarm data for gas mixtures, 
e.g., CO2 laser mixtures, H2-Ar mixtures, N2-SF6 mixtures, 
and atmospheric pressure dry and moist air.  In several 
cases, e.g., He, Ar, and Xe, we have not attempted to 
distinguish among the various excited states and find the 
cross sections satisfactory for models of mixtures and of 
ionization and transport in the pure gases.

Please refer to the published articles where possible.  
Also, please inform me of any errors or inconsistencies.

General remarks on electron collision cross sections:

For a recent review of electron cross sections see:
T. D. Mark, Y. Hatano, and F. Linder, "Electron Collision 
Cross Sections" in "Atomic and molecular data for 
radiotherapy and radiation research" IAEA-TECDOC-799, May 
1995, Chapt. 2. This chapter contains graphical compilations 
of cross sections for Ne, Ar, H2, H2O, CO2, CH4, and C3H8. 
These cross sections have not been compared to those given 
in this file.

M. Hayashi has prepared very extensive bibliographies of papers on 
electron collisions with Ar, H2, O2, N2, CO, H2O, halogen 
molecules, hydrogen halide molecules, CO2, CH4, NH3, and PH3. Some
of these reoprts contain recommended cross sections. Available 
reports are entitled "Bibliography of electron and photon 
cross sections with atoms and molecules published in the 20th century 
- [name of gas] -", National Institute for Fusion Research, Report 
NIFS-Data Series NIFS-DATA-[??]. Unfortunately, the cross sections 
are not available on the Web

Very extensive reviews and compilations of published electron-atom 
and electron-molecule cross sections have been prepared by A. 
Zecca, G. P. Karwasz, and Brusa, Riv. Nuovo Cimento 19, No. 3, 
1-146 (1996) and G. P. Karwasz, R. S. Brusa, and A. Zecca, Riv. 
Nuovo Cimento 24, No. 1, 1-118 (2001) and No. 4, 1-101 (2001). 
Data shown are selected on the basis of  “perceived quality”, 
but no recommended values are given.  Apparently floppy disk(s?) 
giving tabulations can be purchased from the Italian Physical 
Society.  I have not seen the disks, i.e., they are too expensive.  
Unfortunately for gas discharge modeling, the data ranges in 
the review papers are limited, especially for momentum transfer 
cross sections that can differ greatly from "total" cross sections
at the higher energies. 

Stephen Biagi at sfb@hep.ph.liv.ac.uk has derived a sets of 
cross sections for electron collisions with ~ 50 different gases 
that are required to be consistent with electron swarm data. The ~50 
gases include: N2, O2, H20, Ar, CO2, He, Ne, H2, D2, CH4, etc.
Unfortunately, the tabulations of these cross sections are not 
available on the Web.

A recent review of electron-molecule collisions is 
Hotop, Ruf, Allan, and Frabrikant, "Resonances and threshold 
phenomena in low energy electron collisions with molecules and 
clusters", in Advances in Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics,
(Elsevier, 2003) Vol. 49.

A review of experimental integrated and differential cross section
data for electron collisions with some diatomic molecules is 
Brunger and Buckman, Physics Reports, 357, 215 (2002).  The gases 
discussed include H2, O2, N2, the halogens,NO, CO, and halogen 
halides.  This data is tabulated in Landolt-Bornstein, Vol. 17, 
Subvol. C, pp. 35-55 (2003).  Also, Vol 17, Subvol. A is concerned
with electron and photon collisions with atoms, but I do not have 
access to this volume or its data.

GENERAL WARNING TO GAS DISCHARGE MODELERS:

IF AUTHORS DO NOT EXPLICITLY STATE THAT THERE IS AGREEMENT BETWEEN 
A) IONIZATION, EXCITATION, ATTACHMMENT (IF APPLICABLE), AND TRANSPORT 
COEFFICIENTS CALCULATED USING THEIR CROSS SECTIONS AND B) RELIABLE 
EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS OF THESE COEFFICIENTS, YOU SHOULD BE
VERY SKEPTICAL OF ALL OF THEIR CROSS SECTIONS AND OF ELECTRON 
TRANSPORT AND REACTION COEFFICIENT RESULTS DERIVED FROM THEM.  
AGREEMENT WITH SWARM EXPERIMENTS SUCH AS IONIZATION COEFFICIENT, 
DRIFT VELOCITY, THE RATIO OF THE TRANSVERSE AND LOGITUDINAL DIFFUSION 
COEFFICIENT TO MOBILITY, ATTACHMENT COEFFICIENTS, AND EXCITATION 
COEFFICIENTS ARE CRICIAL EVIDENCE OF A RELIABLE SET OF INPUT CROSS 
SECTIONS FOR MODELING.  FOR EACH GAS IN THIS FILE WE HAVE SUMMARIZED 
OUR TESTS OF THE CROSS SECTIONS AGAINST EXPERIMENTAL SWARM DATA.

OXYGEN - O2 - 1978
These cross sections are those developed in Lawton and Phelps, J.
Chem. Phys. 69, 1055 (1978).  The agreement of the transport 
and reaction coefficients is good and is discussed in detail 
in this paper.  Information Center Report No. 28 is based on 
the same computer files as used to assemble the following data.  
As of 9/28/01 I know of no reason to change the cross sections.

Note that the "cross sections" listed under the heading of 
three-body attrachment are expressed as equivalent cross 
sections at an O2 density of 1 molecule/cm3.  This means 
that the rate coefficients k and spatial attachment 
coefficients alpha/n calculated using BACKPRO must be 
multiplied by the O2 density in molecules/cm3 to obtain the 
equivalent of the two-body coefficients per molecule calculated 
for other processes, such as excitation and ionization.

THE FOLLOWING IS NOT PART OF THE ABOVE 1978 SET OF CROSS SECTIONS:

O2 DISSOCIATION - BASED ON TABLE I OF 
P. C. Cosby, J. Chem. Phys. 98, 9560 (1993).

For use in BACKPRO one would need to extend this to the maximum energy of 
the calculation.  I haven't looked to see what would make the best cross 
section to use as a guide - probably the 9.97 eV loss cross section.

A rough estimate of the dissociation of O2 by electrons at
high energies is to use the cross section and rate coefficient 
for the "O2 8.4 LOSS" process given in the above tabe.  This 
approximation will considerably over estimate the dissociation 
according to Cosby at below 30 eV and most usual E/n.  The 
similarity to the estimated Schuman-Runge excitation in the 
1978 set is not surprising, but the discrepancy at energies 
below 30 eV is very bothersome.

A way to calculate the rate coefficients for dissociation of O2 
by electrons is to use the "O2 DISSOCIATION" cross section 
listed above by first multiplying it by, for example, 1E-4; 
using BACKPRO or equivalent to calculate rate coefficients for 
the combined set of cross sections; and multiplying the rate 
coefficient for dissociation by 1E4.  This procedure preserves 
the energy balance, transport coefficients, and ionization 
coefficients of the 1978 set.

ELECTRON ATTACHMENT TO EXCITED O2

These notes were assembled in response to an inquiry as to the
data available data on electron attachment to excited O2.

1)  The dissociative attachment cross section for
O2a-state appears to have been measured most recently
by Jaffke, Meinke, Hashemi, Christophorou, and
Illenberger, Chem. Phys. Lett. 193, 62 (1992).  The
cross section is roughly a Gaussian with a peak
magnitude of 5.7E-18 cm^2 at 5.3 eV.  Other
measurements give significantly lower peak cross
sections of 4.6+-1.3E-18 (Burrow, 1973) and
3.8+-1.2E-18 cm^2 (Belic and Hall, 1981).  Note that if
the Belic and Hall value for the fractional excitation
of the O2a-state were high, e.g., if they missed gas
density reduction because of possible gas heating and
flow effects, their cross section would be low.  I
suggest using a peak value of 5E-18 cm^2.   

Note that some of the experiments show a second peak in
the dissociative attachment cross section from the
O2a-state.  It peaks at 7.5 eV and has a magnitude of
1.7E-18 cm^2.

A very rough estimate of the effects of including
dissociative attachment to the O2a-state is a factor of
two increase in the rate of O formation at typical
discharge electron average energies.  The rate
coefficient for this process would decrease as the
average electron energy is decreased.

2) One should also consider dissociative attachment
from the b-state.  Unfortunately there appear to be no
cross sections.  I would expect the cross section to be
roughly a Gaussian shifted down in energy from that of
the O2a-state dissociative attachment curve by about
the difference in the O2a- and O2b-state thresholds of
0.65 eV.  It should be larger in magnitude by a
significant factor because of a higher survival factor.

I would suggest a peak magnitude of 10E-17 cm^2, which
is close to the maximum allowed for a peak of
reasonable energy width.  Apparently, the dissociative
process is expected to have a second peak at about 6.9
eV.  I would guess this peak to be roughly 5E-18 cm^2.

Overall these processes mean perhaps a factor of 1.5
increase in O formation at high O2b-state
concentration.  Again, the rate coefficient for this
process would decrease as the average electron energyHas 
is decreased.

3) Dissociative attachment to vibrationally excited O2
has been measured, but probably theory is more useful. 
See O'Malley, Phys. Rev. 155, 59 (1967).  Because of
the fast relaxation of vibrationally excited O2 by O,
this may not increase the O- formation significantly.

4) Three-body attachment of electrons to the O2a-state
molecules has been predicted theoretically to be as
much as 1000 times smaller than that for O2X-state
molecules.  See Aleksandrov, Chem. Phys. Lett. 212, 409
(1993).  This will result in a some decrease in the
calculated overall three-body attachment rate
coefficient when the O2a-state fraction becomes
significant.

REVISION OF TOTAL AND PARTIAL IONIZATION CROSS SECTIONS:

See Straub et al, Phys. Rev. A 54, 2146 (1996) and 
Stebbings and Lindsay, J. Chem. Phys. 114, 4741 (2001).

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:

Stephen Biagi at sfb@hep.ph.liv.ac.uk has derived a set of 
electron-O2 cross sections that differ somewhat from the 
above set.  I still prefer the low energy cross sections 
given above.  However, the available experimental and 
theoretical data does not provide definitive values.

NITROGEN - N2 - 1985 SET OF PHELPS AND PITCHFORD

These cross sections are those used in Phelps and 
Pitchford, Phys. Rev. 31, 2932 (1985).  The values tabulated 
in JILA Information Center Report No. 26 are from the same 
computer files.  Since this report was issued, we have 
recommended that the values listed in the report for the 
C^3Pi_u excitation cross section with a threshold at 11.03 eV 
be multiplied by 0.67.  See footnote 15 of Jelenkovic and 
Phelps, Phys. Rev. 36, 5310 (1987).  A few errors in Report 
No. 26 pointed out by M. Hayashi have been corrected, i.e., 
entry 21 for the 11.03 eV loss and entry 3 for the 11.88 eV 
loss.  Here the ionization cross section of Report 26 has 
been divided into two parts so as to facilitate calculation 
of the production N2 1st Negative band emission.

For each of the electronic excitation cross sections in this 1985 
set one can recover the cross section obtained by Phelps and 
Pitchford from analyses of electron beam experiments and theory.  
To do this simply divide the tabulated cross sections by the 
quantity QSCALE listed at the head of the table for that process.

The QSCALE factors in this file are given only so that one can 
recover the input data to BACKPRO, e.g., the input data used by 
P&P (1985).  These QSCALE values should NOT be used when the 
tabulated data is used as input for BACKPRO, i.e., use QSCALE=1.
For N2 these input data were either Schulz’s published vibrational 
excitation cross sections with modification near threshold or 
the electronic excitation cross sections derived by P&P (1985) 
from the literature. The tabulated numbers in Report 26 and 
ELECTRON.TXT (this file) are the result of applying the QSCALE 
factors to the input.  These tabulated values (except for 
C^3Pi_u - see above) were used in the Boltzmann calculations 
of P&P (1985).

It has been pointed out by several authors that the vibrational
excitation cross sections tabilated here (based on Schulz) 
should be updated on the basis of later beam experiments and
theory. However, we find good agreement with six (6) different 
experimental transport and rate coefficients using these cross 
sections and BACKPRO (Levron and Phelps, unpublished).  These
coefficients are drift velocity, characteristic energy, 
ionization, metastable (A^3 Sigma) excitation, C^3 Pi 
excitation, and N2 heating at E/n < 40 Td via rotational 
excitation and anharmonic relaxation of vibrational excitation.  
We therefore believe one would have to have a very strong 
reason before making any significant change in these cross 
sections.  For example, a preliminary investigation (Haddad and 
Phelps, unpublished) suggests that the changes in cross sections 
accompanying the use of a multiterm spherical harmaonic code are 
small.  As a second example, Hadded and Phelps found that the
resonance in the rotational excitation cross section found 
theoretically by Onda and included in the cross sections 
recommended by Itikawa et al. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 15, 
985 (1986) is inconsistent with swarm data and should be ignored.

A good estimate of the dissociation of N2 by electrons is to 
use 0.7 times the cross section and rate coefficient for the
"N2 SUM OF SINGLET STATES" given below.  This approximation will 
be too low for electron energies below 15 eV and very low E/n.  
An alternative is to use the "N2 DISSOCIATION" cross section 
as described below.

See below, for comments on a new set of electron-N2 excitation 
cross sections published by Campbell et al (2001).

END OF PHELPS AND PITCHFORD 1985 SET.

---------

THE FOLLOWING ARE NOT PART OF THE PHELPS AND PITCHFORD (1985) SET OF 
CROSS SECTIONS AND ARE NOT LISTED IN JILA REPOT #26.

RECENT EXCITATION CROSS SECTION RESUTS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION

Very recently Campbell, Brunger, Nolan, Kelly, Wedding, 
Harrison, Teubner, Cartwright, and McLaughlin, J. Phys. B 34, 
1185 (2001) have re-evaluated the published excitation cross 
section data for the important ten lowest electronic states of
N2 and have used this data for a re-analysis of electron 
transport data in N2.  They conclude that the integrated 
cross sections recommended by Phelps and Pitchford (P&P), 
Phys. Rev. 31, 2932 (1985) and tabulated above in this file 
are too small by a significant factor.  My analysis of this
important work is outlined below.

1) A study of their paper finds that their published 
electronic excitation cross sections (their Table 1) for the 
first ten excited states of N2 are in rather good agreement 
with the cross sections derived by (P&P) from the literature.  
The disagreement between these 10 cross sections of Campbell 
et al and the values tabulated above arises because of the 
application by P&P of scaling factors of 2/3 to several of the 
subject cross sections.  See the QSCALE values listed above.  
In other words, if the QSCALE factors from the above table 
were reset to 1.0 there would be no disagreement outside 
stated uncertainties as to the cross sections for excitation 
of the first 10 levels and no significant disagreement as to 
the interpretation of beam experiments and theory for these 
states.

2) For the higher threshold excited states of N2, i.e., 
primarily the singlet states, we believe that the cross sections 
of P&P (1985) are the more reliable.  Apparently the cross 
section set of Campbell et al (2001), other than the first ten 
states, is from the work of Nolan and of Kelly and was "intended 
for the simulation of low to moderate" E/N.

3) The comparisons of the results of P&P (1985) with experiment
in both Fig. 8 of P&P and in Figs. 5 through 9 of Campbell et 
al (2001) require clarification because of the changes in the 
magnitude of the various transport coefficients with the 
experimental technique being modeled.  See Tagashira et al, 
J. Phys. D 10, 1051 (1977) and Blevin et al, Aust. J. Phys. 
37, 593 (1984).  As stated in the text of P&P, but not in 
Fig. 8, the calculations are almost all made for an 
exponentially growing and spatially uniform electron swarm 
(no density gradients), whereas as the experiments shown are 
mostly of the time-of-flight type.  As a result, one expects 
the experimental values to lie above the P&P model results. See 
Taniguchi et al, J. Phys. D 11, 1757 (1978) for comparisons 
of results for various types of experiments obtained using a 
somewhat different set of cross sections for electrons in N2.  
Similarly, one does not expect the the temporal growth results 
of P&P (1985) to agree closely with the time-of flight 
calculations of Campbell et al (2001) or with the some what 
divergent time-of-flight experiments of Wedding et al, J. Phys. 
D 18, 2361 (1985) and Roznerski, J. Phys. D 29, 614 (1996).

4) It should be kept in mind that the experimental values 
for the electron drift velocities and characteristic energies 
have changed since the experiments cited by P&P.  
Assuming that tne newer experimental results are better, the 
QSCALE factors used by P&P and tabulated above probably have 
to be changed toward unity and the cross sections for the 
first 10 states changed toward the Campbell et al (2001) values.

5) The net result of the inconsistencies in the published
comparisons of the results of P&P (1985) with experiments 
and with the calculated results of Campbell et al (2001) is 
that we do not know the errors resulting from the use of the 
P&P (1985) cross sections. Note that according to A. Nolan 
(private communication), Campbell et al (2001) did not 
calculate transport coefficients using the cross sections of 
P&P (1985) - unfortunately designated as the "JILA" set by 
Campbell et al. These and related questions have been 
investigated by A. Cenian and collaborators using 
Monte Carlo techniques.  See Cenian et al, J. Phys. B 35, 
5163 (2002); Cenian and Chernykho, Radiation Physics and 
Chemistry 68, 103 (2003).

6) My present guess (5/23/02) is that the uncertainties in the 
experimental transport data will turn out to be comparable 
with the differences in calculated drift velocities, 
characteristic energies, and ionization coefficients when 
using the cross sections of Campbell et al (2001) or those 
of P&P (1985) as tabulated above. If this is the case, then 
the fact that the Campbell et al cross sections for the first 
10 states are derived from electron beam experiments and 
theory would favor the use of the Campbell et al cross 
sections for the first 10 states and those listed above from 
P&P (1985) for the higher states.  Because of the problems 
in obtaining a listing of the Campbell et al cross sections 
and in dealing with the ~ 1 million entries, it is suggested 
that one obtain a very nearly equivalent cross section set 
for all electronic excitation by dividing the entries given 
above for P&P (1985) by their associated QSCALE factors.  
The vibrational excitation cross sections listed above 
should not be rescaled.

I thank A. Nolan and A. B. Wedding (private communication) 
for listings of the cross section sets of Campbell et al 
(2001).  I thank A. Cenian for several emails and preliminary 
Monte Carlo results leading to the analysis given here.

N2 DISSOCIATION - FROM TABLE II OF 
P. C. Cosby, J. Chem. Phys. 98, 9544 (1993).

For use in BACKPRO one would need to extend this to the 
maximum energy of the calculation using the "SUM OF SINGLETS" 
cross section as a guide.  

DO NOT ADD THIS TO THE SET OF CROSS SECTIONS GIVEN ABOVE.  SUCH AN
ERROR WOULD COUNT DISSOCIATION TWICE IN THE BOLTZMANN CALCULATION.
SIMILARLY, FOR THE DISSOCIATION CROSS SECTION OF WINTERS (1966).

To use this cross section listed below with any
Boltzmann code that uses the cross section set given above:
1) multiply it by a small number, for example, 1E-4; 
2) use BACKPRO or equivalent to calculate rate coefficients for 
the combined set of cross sections; 
3) multiply the rate coefficient for dissociation by 1E4.  
This procedure preserves the energy balance, transport 
coefficients, and ionization coefficients of the 1985 set.

N2 - ANALYTICAL APPROXIMATIONS TO DIFFERENTIAL SCATTERING 
CROSS SECTIONS FOR ELECTRON SCATTERING

We use a screened-Coulomb type scattering formula to 
approximate the angular distributions of scattered electrons.
Our choice allows fitting data that is predominantly backward
scattering, e.g., O2 at low energies, and goes over 
to predominantly forward scattering at high energies.  

The differential scattering cross section 
i(theta,beta,en) is assumed to be

i = a*(1 -(1 - 2*beta[en])*Cos[theta])^-2

where theta is the scattering angle, beta is a 
screening parameter and is a function of the 
electron energy, and en is the electron energy. Here a 
is the conventional magnitude factor for Coulomb 
scattering and is a function of electron energy only.  

Integration yields the total cross section qt 

qt = -((a*Pi)/((-1 + beta)*beta));

and the momentum transfer cross section qm 

qm = (2*Pi*(a - 2*a*beta - a*Ln[2 - 2*beta] + 
      a*beta*Ln[2 - 2*beta] + a*Ln[2*beta] -
      a*beta*Ln[2*beta]))/((-1 + beta)*(-1 + 2*beta)^2)

so that the ratio of the momentum transfer cross section to the 
total cross sections qm/qt is

ratio = (2*beta*(-1 + 2*beta + 
         Ln[2 - 2*beta] - beta*Ln[2 - 2*beta] - 
         Ln[2*beta] + beta*Ln[2*beta]))/
        (-1 + 2*beta)^2;

The differential scattering cross sections normalized to 
the total cross section is

normi = i[theta,eta]/qt[beta]

so that probability of scattering through an 
angle less than theta0 is

prob = (1 - Cos[theta0])*(1 - beta)/
  (1 - (1 - 2*beta)Cos[theta0]);

For theta0 = Pi this is 1 as expected.  
We set prob equal to a random number, randomnum, and 
solve for the scattering angle theta0.

theta0 = ArcCos[(1 - beta - randomnum)/
      (1 - beta - randomnum + 2*beta*randomnum)]

Application to the scattering of electrons by N2:

As in Phelps and Pitchford, Phys. Rev. A 31, 2932 (1985),
we only attempt to fit the experimental angular 
distributions at energies for which the particular 
scattering cross section is important to the solution of 
the electron Boltzmann equation.  See Table I.

The empirical expressions used for the lowest two 
spherical harmonic components of the angular scattering 
are taken from Table I of this reference.  The magnitudes 
of the effective Qm and angular integrated qt for the various 
inelastic scattering processes can be taken from the tables 
given earlier in this file.

From Phelps and Pitchford, Phys. Rev. A 31, 2932 (1985), 
Table I, one obtains values of qm(en)/q0(en).  The 
empirical q1/q0 expressions are then set equal to the expression 
for "ratio" and the value of beta is evaluated numerically, 
not algebraically.  A graph of such beta values is then 
fitted by an algebraic expression for "empiricalbeta" by trial 
and error.  Note that here qm is the elastic momentum transfer 
cross secton, not the effective Qm.

q1/q0 = -0.2*en^0.5/(0.025+en^0.5)+
         1.2*(16*en^0.5+en)/(100+16*en^0.5+en);
qm/q0 = 1 - q1/q0; (q0 = qt everywhere);
empiricalbeta = .6/(1+(en/50.0)^0.5+(en/20.0)^1.01)^0.99;

Resonant vibrational excitation:
Since the scattering is roughly isotropic, beta = 0.5.
(Corrected 12/10/96 thanks to A. Gilardini)

Lower triplet states- A, B, and W:
q1/q0 = -en^2/(1500+en^2);
qm/q0 = 1 - q1/q0;
empiricalbeta = .5*(1+(en/20.0)^2)/(1+(en/28.2)^2);

Upper triplet state - C:
q1/q0 = -0.2;
qm/q0 = 1 - q1/q0;
empiricalbeta = .647;

Lower singlet state - a1Pi:
q1/q0 = (200000+ 160*en^2+en^4)/(200000+2600*en^2+en^4);
qm/q0 = 1 - q1/q0;
empiricalbeta = 0.4*(en/15.0)^2/(1+(en/30.0)^2+(en/22.0)^4);

Sum of singlets:
q1/q0 = en^2/(2500+en^2);
qm/q0 = 1 - q1/q0;
empiricalbeta = .5/(1+(en/37.0)^2.5);

The differential cross sections derived from the preceding 
tabulation have not been used in Boltzmann or Monte Carlo 
calculations so as to compare with the more detailed 
angular distributions used by others, e.g., Kunhardt and 
Tzeng, Phys. Rev. A 34, 2148 and 2158 (1986), Stojanovic, 
Jelenkovic, and Petrovic, J. Appl. Phys. 81, 1601 (1997),
and Stojanovic and Petrovic, J. Phys. D 31, 834 (1998). 
A similar approximation to the differential cross section
was made for N2 by Pitchford, Physics and Applications of 
Pseudo Sparks, (Wiley, New York, 1990) p. 319.  Also, 
Jelenkovic and Phelps (unpublished) (1995) have used 
such an approximation for Monte Carlo calculations for 
electrons in H2.  Belenguer and Pitchford, J. Appl. Phys. 
86, 4780 (1999) used this form for anisotropic electron-Ar 
collisions. 

A very thorough and more detailed representation of the 
differential cross sections for electrons in N2 at energies 
from 2.3 to 1000 eV is given by Porter et al, J. Geophys. 
Res. 92, 5933 (1987).

We thank A. Okhrimovskyy (8/27/00 and 3/8/01) for pointing out
a typographical in the equation for i, poor terminology 
in the discusstion of the cumulative probability, an 
inconsistency in the energy scales for the empirical beta 
formulas, and the need for more detail in the description of 
the evaluation the empirical beta.

REVISION OF TOTAL AND PARTIAL IONIZATION CROSS SECTIONS

Mangan et al, J. Phys. B 33, 3225 (2000).

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:

Stephen Biagi at sfb@hep.ph.liv.ac.uk has derived a set of 
electron-CO cross sections that differ somewhat from the 
above set.

HYDROGEN 

These cross sections are those used by Buckman and Phelps, 
J. Chem. Phys. 82, 4999 (1985).  The values tabulated in JILA 
Information Center Report No. 27 are derived from the same 
computer files and should be the same as those given here. 
This has not been checked.  Although these cross sections give good 
agreement with experimental transport, dissociation, 
vuv excitation, and ionization coeffieient data, it is now 
known that the division of cross sections among the triplet levels 
needs to be improved.  This problem does not introduce significant 
errors in the overall energy balance or the sums of excitation rates 
for the H2 singlet and triplet levels.

M. Hayashi has assembled references and derived an electron-H2 cross 
section set in a report entitled "Bibliography of electron and photon 
cross sections with atoms and molecules published in the 20th century 
- Hydrogen Molecules", National Institute for Fusion Research Research, 
Report NIFS-Data Series NIFS-DATA-82, Feb. 2004. The report does not 
contain a set of recommended cross sections, but has some relevant 
comments at the end. The report cited is one of a series that gives
bibliographies of papers on electron collisions with various gases.

Badly in need of updata.  However, when this set is used for moist air 
it gives good agreement with experiment (Davies unpublished).  The only 
adjustable parameter was the probability of collisional stabilization 
of excited O2- by H2O in three-body attachment (Phelps unpublished).

Stebbings and Lindsay, J. Chem. Phys. 114, 4741 (2001).

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:

Stephen Biagi at sfb@hep.ph.liv.ac.uk has derived a set of 
electron-H2O cross sections. 
Communicated December 2003

M. Hayashi has assembled references and plots an electron-Ar cross 
section set in a report entitled "Bibliography of electron and photon 
cross sections with atoms and molecules published in the 20th century 
- water vapour -", National Institute for Fusion Research, Report 
NIFS-Data Series NIFS-DATA-81, Dec. 2003. The report cited is one of 
a series that reviews electron collisions with Ar, Xe, SF6, N2, etc.

REVISION OF PARTIAL IONIZATION CROSS SECTIONS

See Rejoub et al, J. Phys. B 34, 1289 (2001).

M. Hayashi has assembled references and derived an electron-Ar cross 
section set in a report entitled "Bibliography of electron and photon 
cross sections with atoms and molecules published in the 20th century 
- sulphur hexafluoride", National Institute for Fusion Research Research, Report 
NIFS-Data Series NIFS-DATA-76, May 2003. In 
an appendix to this reoprt Hayashi gives a set of recommended 
electron-SF6 cross sections.  The report cited is one of a series 
that reviews electron collisions with Ar, Xe, and N2.

Our recommendataion for a "complete" set of electron-helium cross 
sections is Alves and Ferreira, J. Phys. D 24, 561 (1991).  This set has 
the very important adavantage that the authors show the consistency of 
their cross section set with swarm experiments. Unfortunately, this set 
does not appear to be available in tabulated or analytic form in a 
publication or on the Web.

A new set of electron helium cross sections has been published by Ralchenko 
et al, Research Report NIFS-Data-59, Nagoya, October 2000.  As far as I know this 
set has not been tested against experimental swarm data.  I do not know 
whether it is available on the Web.

A more detailed set of electron-neon excitation cross sections is given by
Puech and Mizzi, J. Phys. D 24, 1974 (1991).  This set has been compared 
with swarm experiments and is available in analytic form.  A worrisome
aspect of this set is that the authors find a large discrepancy between 
the calculated metastable excitation coefficients and the measured values
of Tachibana and Phelps, Phys. Rev. A 36, 999 (1987).  This discrepancy 
occurs even at E/N that are low enough so the cascade effects should be 
negligible.

ARGON

Originally from Yamabe, Buckman, and Phelps, Phys. Rev. 27, 1345 (1983).
For energies below 3.0 eV these momentum transfer cross sections appear to 
have been based on Miloy, Crompton, Rees, and Robertson, Aust. J. Phys. 
30, 61 (1977).  For higher energies the elastic momentum transfer cross 
section appears to be based on the tabulation by M. Hayashi, Institute of 
Plasma Physics Report No. IPPJ-AM-19, 1981.  See note at end of this Ar 
section.

REVISION OF 10/15/97.  
The momentum transfer cross sections listed for high energies were been 
revised as of 10/15/97 because of an error in the previous listing.  The 
previous listing appeares to be the elastic momentum transfer cross 
section for energies up to 100 eV and the effective momentum transfer cross 
section for higher energies.  The effective momentum transfer cross section 
is the momentum transfer cross section that should be used in the two-term 
spherical harmonic expansion.  It is equal to the sum of the elastic 
momentum transfer cross section and the sum of the "total" (angular 
integrated) inelastic cross sections.  For discussions of this point see 
Baraff and Buchsbaum, Phys. Rev. 130, 1007 (1963) and Pitchford and Phelps, 
Phys. Rev. A 25, 540 (1982). 

This revision also includes extension of the total excitation cross section
to 10 keV.  At energies above 30 eV we have used values based on deHeer et al.
that are about 10% lower than those of Eggarater, J. Chem. Phys. 62, 833 
(1975) and those based on Peterson and Allen, J. Chem. Phys. 56, 6068 (1972).
The effects of these changes on electron transport and reaction rate 
coefficients have been incorporated in the file TRANSPOR.TXT.

ELASTIC MOMENTUM-TRANSFER CROSS SECTION  - added 11/2/97

This elastic momentum transfer cross section is provided for use by modelers
with, for example, Monte Carlo codes that require the elastic momentum 
cross section rather than the effective momentum transfer cross section 
given above.  This cross section is the same as above for energies below 
the first excitation potential.  For higher energies it is from the 
tabulation by M. Hayashi, Institute of Plasma Physics Report No. 
IPPJ-AM-19, 1981.  When the sum of the inelastic cross sections given 
above is added to the elastic momentum transfer cross section we obtain 
an effective momentum transfer cross section in agreement with that 
tabulated above to within their respective uncertainties.

THE FOLLOWING ARE NOT PART OF THE SET OF CROSS SECTIONS USED 
TO CALCULATE THE TRANSPORT AND IONIZATION COEFFICIENTS FOR Ar
LISTED IN THE FILE TRANSPOR.TXT.

Their contributions to the energy loss, etc. are included in 
the "total" excitation cross sections listed above.

Rate coefficients and spatial excitation coefficients for the 
following three levels of Ar can be calculated by using the 
cross sections listed below by first multiplying each cross
section by, for example, 1E-4; using BACKPRO or equivalent to 
calculate rate coefficients for the combined set of cross 
sections; and multiplying the rate coefficient for these 
proceses by 1E4.  This procedure preserves the energy balance, 
transport coefficients, and ionization coefficients 
calculated with the preceding set of cross sections.

ANALYTIC CROSS SECTIONS  (corrected 04/27/02-Thanks to Z. Donko)

The following are analytic approximations to the elastic momentum transfer
cross section Qmel, the effective momentum transfer cross section Qmeff,
the total excitation cross section Qex, and the ionization cross section Qion.
The combination Qmeff, Qex, and Qion has been used in the two-term Boltzmann 
code ELENDIF and to obtain calculated ionization coefficients that are 
within 15% of the experimental data of Kruithof (1940) for E/n from 30 to 300 
Td.  The cross sections are in m^2 and the energies, en, are in eV.

Qex = 0.85*(4E-22*(en-11.5)^1.1*(1+(en/15)^2.8)/(1+(en/23)^5.5)
             + 2.7E-22*(en-11.5)/(1+(en/80))^1.9)

Qion = 9.7E-18*(en-15.8)/(70+en)^2 + 6E-22*(en-15.8)^2*exp(-en/9)

Qmel = (ABS(6/(1+(en/0.1)+(en/0.6)^2)^3.3 -
         1.1*en^1.4/(1+(en/15)^1.2)/(1+(en/5.5)^2.5+(en/60)^4.1)^0.5) +
         0.05/(1+en/10)^2 + 0.01*en^3/(1+(en/12)^6))*1.0E-20

One should use Qmeff = Qmel + Qex + Qion for the effective momentum transfer 
cross section in the two-term Boltzmann equation. 

OTHER CROSS SECTION SOURCES:

A detailed published set of electron-Ar cross sections is V. Puech and L. 
Torchin, J. Phys. D, 19, 2309 (1986).  Unfortunately, tabulations of this 
cross section set do not appear to be publically available.  A disturbing 
feature of the Puech and Torchin set of cross sections is the large discrepancy 
between calculated and measured [Tachibana, Phys. Rev. A 34, 1007 (1986)] metastable 
excitation coefficients.

See Pack, Voshall, and Phelps, J. Appl. Phys. 71, 5363 (1992) for 
a recent analysis of He, Ar, Kr, and Xe using the two-term approximation 
over a very wide range of E/n.  I do not have files listing the 
inelastic cross sections used in these calculations.

Through the efforts of Professor K. Nanbu we have obtained 
permission to presnt a tabulation of the unpublished electron-Ar cross 
section set of Professor M. Hayashi in the file Hayashi.txt.  As discussed 
in this file, Hayashi's cross section set Has been shown to give fair agreement 
with swarm experiments by Nanbu and Kageyama, Vacuum 47, 1031 (1996).  I 
have not attempted a direct comparison of Hayahsi's cross sections with

Stephen Biagi at sfb@hep.ph.liv.ac.uk has derived a set of 
electron-Ar cross sections that are consistent with swarm data. 
Private communication March 2002

M. Hayashi has assembled references and derived an electron-Ar cross 
section set in a report entitled "Bibliography of electron and photon 
cross sections with atoms and molecules published in the 20th century 
- argon", National Institute for Fusion Research Research, Report 
NIFS-Data Series NIFS-DATA-72, Jan. 2003. In 
an appendix to this reoprt Hayashi gives a set of recommended 
electron-Ar cross sections. This set is the same as that tabulated in 
the accompanying file Hayashi.txt.  The report cited is one of a series 
that reviews electron collisions with Xe, N2, SF6, and CO2

KRYPTON

I do not know of a cross section tabulation for Kr.

The best set of cross sections for electrons in krypton that I know of 
is that of Date et al, J. Phys. D 22, 1478 (1989).  They give cross sections
for excitation of the metastable states, but it is difficult to know
how much of the higher excited states cascade to the metastable
states. One would have to model such things as the trapping of
resonance radiation, collisional coupling by atoms and electrons, excited 
molecule formation, etc.  A more recent momentum transfer cross 
section is given by Brennan and Ness, Australian J. Phys. 46, 249 
(1993), but I would question the advisability of replacing the Date 
et al momentum transfer values with these results without a thorough 
analyses of the consequences.

OTHER CROSS SECTION SOURCES FOR XENON


A detailed set of electron-xenon excitation cross sections is 
given by Puech and Mizzi, J. Phys. D 24, 1974 (1991).  This set has 
been compared with swarm experiments and is available in analytic form.
I have not had occasion to check or to use these cross sections.
A word of caution: Note that although most coefficients calculated by
Puech and Mizzi for Ne in the same paper agree with experiment, the
calculated metastable excitation coefficients for Ne are not in
agreement with the measurements and model of Tachibana and Phelps 
Phys. Rev. A 36, 999 (1987).  How this problem carrys over to Xe is 
unknown.

See Pack, Voshall, and Phelps, J. Appl. Phys. 71, 5363 (1992) for 
an analysis of He, Ar, Kr, and Xe using the two-term approximation 
over a very wide range of E/n.  I do not have files listing the 
inelastic cross sections used in these calculations.

M. Hayashi has assembled references and derived an electron-Xe cross 
section set in a report entitled "Bibliography of electron and photon 
cross sections with atoms and molecules published in the 20th century 
- xenon", National Institute for Fusion Research Research, Research 
Report NIFS-Data Series NIFS-DATA-79, Sept. 2003. In 
an appendix to this reoprt Hayashi gives a set of recommended 
electron-Xe cross sections. This set presumably replaces the cross 
sections in Hayashi, J. Phys. D 16, 581 and 591 (1983).  The report 
cited is one of a series that reviews electron collisions with Ar, N2, 
SF6 and CO2.

Stephen Biagi at sfb@hep.ph.liv.ac.uk has derived a set of 
electron-O3 cross sections. 
Private communication March 2002



HYDROGEN HALIDE MOLECULES

M. Hayashi has assembled references and derived an electron-HF, HCl, HBr,
and HI cross section set in a report entitled "Bibliography of electron and 
photon cross sections with atoms and molecules published in the 20th century 
- Hydrogen Halide Molecules", National Institute for Fusion Research Research, 
Report NIFS-Data Series NIFS-DATA-83, Mar. 2004. The report does not 
contain sets of recommended cross sections, but has some relevant 
comments at the end. The report cited is one of a series that gives
bibliographies of papers on electron collisions with various gases.
